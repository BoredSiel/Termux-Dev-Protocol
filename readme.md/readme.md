Termux Dev Protocol

A lightning-fast development workflow built entirely inside Termux, without the need for a graphical interface or PC.

This repository documents and showcases how to build full-scale software, AI, automation, and IoT projects using only:

A phone

Termux (Linux environment)

GitHub

Code, intent, and recursion



---

Why Termux?

Speed: No bloated IDEs, no lag

Power: Full Linux toolchain in your pocket

Discipline: Forces clean architecture and automation

Freedom: No dependence on desktops or cloud lock-in

Features of This Protocol

GitHub repo creation, structure, and management via Termux

Alias and script automation for ultra-fast commits (gdeploy, gpush, etc.)

Python project structure, testing, and logging directly from the terminal

End-to-end IoT project examples (e.g. Smart GrowBox)

Custom HTML/CSS websites built and deployed via Git from phone

Recursive intelligence structures, automation layers, symbolic systems
